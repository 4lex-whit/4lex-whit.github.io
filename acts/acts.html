					<h3>What is the CDPA?</h3>
					<p>The <em>Copyright, Designs, & Patents Act</em> was introduced in 1988, and protects the <strong>intellectual property</strong> (defined as <em>"intangible creations of the human intellect"</em>) of a person or organisation.</p>
					<p>Copyright is <strong>automatically</strong> applied to <strong>original</strong> pieces of strongwork, and - depending on the type of work - will only expire 25 to 70 years after the owner's death.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Breaches -->

					<h3>What breaches the CDPA?</h3>
					<p>Breaches of the Copyright, Designs, & Patents Act are divided into two categories; <a href="#breaches_primary">Primary Breaches</a> and <a href="#breaches_secondary">Secondary Breaches</a>. However, if a person or organisation has the <strong>relevant permission</strong>, it does not breach the act.</p>
					<p>If someone believes their copyright has been breached, it is their responsibility to take action under the act.</p>

					<h3>What is the CMA?</h3>
					<p>The <em>Computer Misuse Act</em> legislates the <strong>malicious use of computers</strong>, and was first introduced in 1990 - but is updated regularly to ensure it remains relevant.</p>
					<p>It was first introduced due to two people gaining unauthorised access to a British Telecom's account after "shoulder-surfing" the username and password. They were charged under the <em>Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981</em>, but acquitted due to the act not being intended for this use case, and they faced no charges. After this, the <em>Computer Misuse Act 1990</em> was introduced to prevent this happening in the future, and make the laws clearer.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Primary Offences -->
				<div id="cma-primary-offences" class="item">
					<h3>What are the primary offences?</h3>
					<p>The CMA has <strong>three primary offences</strong>, and offenders face different charges depending on which is broken - but all can result in time in prison.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>
							<strong>Unauthorised Access to Computer Materials</strong><br>
							Example: <em>a student finding out a teacher's password, and then logging into their account and viewing their files</em>.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<strong>Unauthorised Access with Intent to Commit Further Offences</strong><br>
							Example: <em>a student finding out a teacher's password, and then logging into their account with the intent to increase their mark on a test</em>.
						</li>
						<br>
						<li>
							<strong>Unauthorised Modification of Computer Files</strong><br>
							Example: <em>a student finding out a teacher's password, and then logging into their account and increasing their mark on a test</em>.

				<!-- Description -->
				<div id="dpa-description" class="item">
					<h3>What is the DPA?</h3>
					<p>The <em>Data Protection Act</em> was introduced in 1998 to protect the <strong>collection</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, and <strong>storing</strong> of data. If these laws are broken, the organisation is referred to the <em>Information Commissioner's Office</em>.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Data Collection -->
				<div id="dpa-collection" class="item">
					<h3>Data Collection</h3>
					<p>According to the <em>Data Protection Act 1998</em>, organisations have to have a <strong>legitimate reason</strong> to collect data. For example, a revision website could ask to collect your email address so they can contact you, but not things like your height and weight.</p>
					<p>The data is categorised into either <strong>Personal</strong> or <strong>Sensitive</strong> data. For example, personal data for a college could be a student's name, address, or phone number, while sensitive data could be your policial party, religion, bank account number, etc.</p>
					<p>Data is categorised differently depending on the purpose of the organisation - while a bank account number would be sensitive for a college, it would be personal for a bank. A company must be authorised to store sensitive data on a subject.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Processing -->
				<div id="dpa-processing" class="item">
					<h3>Data Processing</h3>
					<p>Data processing must be done <strong>lawfully</strong>, <strong>transparently</strong>, and <strong>in a fair way</strong>. This means the organisation must be clear on what information is stored about a subject, and what it's used for.</p>
					<p>The term <em>fair</em> is potentially problematic, as what an organisation deems fair might not be the same as what the subject does.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Storage -->
				<div id="dpa-storage" class="item">
					<h3>Data Storage</h3>
					<p>The <em>Data Protection Act 1998</em> states that data must be <strong>accessible</strong> to the subject. This means that, if requested, the organisation has to provide the subject with all the data they have concerning them.</p>
					<p>In addition to this, data must be stored in a <strong>timely manner</strong>. This means that an organisation can only store data for as long as it is necessary, and it must be deleted when no longer. For example, a college would be required to delete your photograph after you leave, as it's no longer required for them.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- GDPR -->
				<div id="dpa-gdpr" class="item">
					<h3>What is the GDPR?</h3>
					<p>The GDPR stands for the <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em>, and it was introduced by the <strong>European Union</strong> to further regulate the processing of person data in 2018.</p>
					<p>This regulation gave subjects more rights about their data, allowing them to <strong>request data be deleted</strong>, and forcing organisations to <strong>request to store data on children</strong>.</p>

				<!-- Description -->
				<div id="ripa-description" class="item">
					<h3>What is the RIPA?</h3>
					<p>The RIPA stands for the <em>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</em>, and it legislates how organisations can monitor <strong>electronic communications</strong>. The term <em>electronic communications</em> covers a broad range of cases, including <strong>internet searches</strong>, <strong>emails</strong>, <strong>text messages</strong>, and <strong>phone calls</strong>.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Who -->
				<div id="ripa-who" class="item">
					<h3>Who can use the RIPA?</h3>
					<p>Only certain organisations are permitted to use the RIPA, and they have <strong>different levels</strong> of freedom based on how they will use it. For example, the GCHQ (Government Communication Headquarters) and MI6 have the most freedom and require little government approval, while local councils have significantly less.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Capabilities -->
				<div id="ripa-capabilities" class="item">
					<h3>What are the capabilities of the RIPA?</h3>
					<p>The RIPA is a very powerful act, and - depending on who's using it - can be used for a wide variety of tasks. Its primary purpose is the tracking of criminals, and to do this it allows <strong>investigation</strong>, <strong>surveillance</strong>, and <strong>interception</strong>.</p>
					<p><em>Investigation</em> allows organisations to view your <strong>internet searches</strong>, <strong>emails</strong>, <strong>text messages</strong>, <strong>phone calls</strong>, and more. It isn't limited to a certain time frame either, as messages from years previous can be viewed.</p>
					<p><em>Surveillance</em> allows organisations to actively monitor you, be it through your online presence, or physical. They can conduct <strong>wiretaps</strong> to listen in on phone calls, and plant <strong>secret listening devices</strong> for real life conversations.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Issues -->
				<div id="ripa-issues" class="item">
					<h3>What are the issues with the RIPA?</h3>
					<p>Due to the nature of the RIPA, it's obviously very controversial. One of these controversies stems from the <strong>types of organisations</strong> that have access to the RIPA, as they not only include high-profile organisations, but smaller ones like <strong>local councils</strong>. Some claim that they have no need for direct access to the RIPA, and wouldn't be using it under its <strong>defined purposes</strong>.</p>
					<p>This is supported by the case where a family was being monitored by a local council to check if they were within the catchment area for a local school - something the RIPA is definitely not intended for.</p>
					<p>However, many say that these are outweighed by the positives of the RIPA, having solved multiple large cases in the past including the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soham_murders">Soham murders</a></strong>.</p>
					<p>Another extremely controversial part of the RIPA is that it <strong>prevents the existence of such interception activities being revealed in court</strong>, meaning that they are never required to prove that it was used in an investigation, or that it was used lawfully.</p>
