			<h2>What is the Computer Misuse Act?</h2>
			<p>The <i>Computer Misuse Act</i> legislates the <strong>malicious use of computers</strong>, and was first introduced in 1990 - but is updated regularly to ensure it remains relevant.</p>
			<p>It was first introduced due to two people gaining unauthorised access to a British Telecom's account after "shoulder-surfing" the username and password. They were charged under the <i>Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981</i>, but acquitted due to the act not being intended for this use case, and they faced no charges. After this, the <i>Computer Misuse Act 1990</i> was introduced to prevent this happening in the future, and make the laws clearer.</p>
