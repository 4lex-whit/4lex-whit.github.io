				<h2>What is a Cyber Security Policy?</h2>
				<p>A <em>Cyber Security Policy</em> is a set of <strong>rules and guidelines</strong> that govern computer activities in an organisation. It instructs users on how to best protect their data from potential threats, and outlines rules they must follow.</p>
				<p>Some common examples of these rules are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You cannot download software</li>
					<li>You cannot log into other people's accounts</li>
					<li>You cannot modify the system settings</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>How does the College's Policy Protect Data?</h2>
				<p>One of the ways the College's <em>Cyber Security Policy</em> protects data is through the enforcement of <strong>passwords</strong>. A user's password must be at least a certain length, and contain different types of characters. It also must be changed every three months. These rules ensure that passwords remain secure, and significantly reduces the risk of people gaining access to someone's account for a prolonged period.</p>
				<p>In addition to this, it adheres to the <em>Data Protection Act 1998</em> by storing data in a <strong>timely manner</strong> - meaning that the college doesn't store data past a reasonable amount of time. For example, your college photo will be stored only while you are at the college, and deleted as soon as you leave. However, your files are stored for a few years after due to possibly being required for coursework.</p>
