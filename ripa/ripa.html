			<h2>What is RIPA?</h2>
			<p>RIPA stands for the <i>Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</i>, and it legislates how organisations can monitor electronic communications. The term <i>electronic communications</i> covers a broad range of cases, including internet searches, emails, text messages, and phone calls.</p>

			<h2>Who can use RIPA?</h2>
			<p>Only certain organisations are permitted to use RIPA, and they have different levels of freedom based on how they will use it. For example, the GCHQ (Government Communication Headquarters) and MI6 have the most freedom and require little government approval, while local councils have significantly less.</p>

			<h2>What are the capabilities of RIPA?</h2>
			<p>RIPA is a very powerful act, and - depending on who's using it - can be used for a wide variety of tasks. Its primary purpose is the tracking of criminals, and to do this it allows <i>investigation</i>, <i>surveillance</i>, and <i>interception</i>.</p>
			<p>Investigation allows organisations to view your internet searches, emails, text messages, phone calls, and more. It isn't limited to a certain time frame either, as messages from years previous can be viewed.</p>
			<p>Surveillance allows organisations to actively monitor you, be it through your online presence, or physical. They can conduct wiretaps to listen in on phone calls, and plant secret listening devices for real life conversations.</p>
			<p>However, an extremely controversial part of RIPA is that it prevents the existence of such interception activities being revealed in court, meaning that they are never required to prove that it was used in an investigation, or that it was used lawfully.</p>
