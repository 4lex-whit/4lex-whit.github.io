				<!-- Narrow AI -->
				<div id="category_narrow" class="item">
					<h3>Narrow AI</h3>
					<p>
						Narrow AI is AI designed to complete very specific tasks. It's the simplest form of AI and is most commonly used for <em>Facial Recognition</em>, <em>Simple Virtual Assistants</em>, and <em>Recommendation Systems</em> on streaming services.
					</p>
				</div>
		
				<!-- General AI -->
				<div id="category_general" class="item">
					<h3>General AI</h3>
					<p>
						General AI is AI designed to learn, think, and perform any intellectual task at similar levels to humans. They have a much greater range than <em>Narrow AI</em>, and are most commonly used for <em>Advanced Virtual Assistants</em>, <em>Autonomous Vehicles</em>, and <em>Medical Diagnosis</em>.
					</p>
				</div>
		
				<!-- Super AI -->
				<div id="category_super" class="item">
					<h3>Super AI</h3>
					<p>
						Super AI is AI designed to surpass the knowledge and capabilities of humans and is the 'final form' of AI. Although not yet acheived, it's applications are potentially unlimited. Some examples of these are <em>Scientific Research</em>, <em>Drug Discovery and Devlopment</em>, <em>Climate Modelling and Prediction</em>, and <em>Crisis Response and Management</em>.

				<h2>Types of AI</h2>

						<li><a href="#type_reactive">Reactive Machine AI</a></li>

				<!-- Reactive Machines -->
				<div id="type_reactive" class="item">
					<h3>Reactive Machine AI</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Reactive Machine AI</em> is designed to react to data in real-time and make decisions based on the current state of the environment. They rarely hold data for long amounts of time as it's only used when reacting to it.<br>
						The main example of this is <em>Autonomous Vehicles</em>, which must react to live traffic data using sensors and make almost-instantaneous decisions.
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- Limited Memory -->
				<div id="type_limited_memory" class="item">
					<h3>Limited Memory AI</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Limited Memory AI</em> is designed to remember and learn from a certain amount of past data. This is useful in systems that limits on computational resources, such as processing power and memory.<br>
						An example of this is <em>Smart Grids</em> and <em>Traffic Management</em>, which both analyze real-time data from sensors to effectively manage power demand and traffic congestion.
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- Theory of Mind -->
				<div id="type_theory_of_mind" class="item">
					<h3>Theory of Mind AI</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Theory of Mind AI</em> is designed to understand the mental states of humans and even other AI, and that their perspectives, knowledge, motivations, etc., may differ from its own.<br>
						Some applications of this include <em>Social Robots</em> (specifically those designed for healthcare, education, and assistance for the elderly), as it would be important for them to understand intentions and social cues.
					</p>
				</div>
	
				<!-- Self-Aware -->
				<div id="type_self_aware" class="item">
					<h3>Self-Aware AI</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Self-Aware AI</em> is designed to have consciousness and understand their own existence. They would have a level of general intelligence comparable to or greater than that of humans.
						Despite not yet being achieved, the applications of this are potentially unlimited. They range from <em>Ethical Descision Making</em> to <em>Human Companions</em> that could even be mentally indishtinguishable from real humans.

				</div>

				<!-- Positives -->
				<div id="ethics_positives" class="item">
					<h3>Positives</h3>

					<ul>
						<li id="ethics_dangerous_mundane_tasks">
							<strong>Dangerous/Mundane Tasks</strong><br>
							One key positive of AI is the completion of tasks that are especially dangerous for humans (such as deep-sea construction), or even mundane tasks like sorting types of plastic at recycling centres. This then allows humans to focus on more important and typically fulfilling jobs.
						</li>
						<li id="ethics_human_error">
							<strong>Human Error</strong><br>
							AI is significantly less likely to make errors with certain tasks than humans, as they do not fatigue. This allows them to perform specific tasks better by removing any chance of human-error from them.
						</li>
						<li id="ethics_super_efficient_designs">
							<strong>Super-Efficient Designs</strong><br>
							AI would be able to come up with new, super-efficient designs for technology and mechanics by running advanced simulations. For example, fighter jets currently use a wing design discovered by chance during testing (a diamond shape) to be much more efficient than the standard, but it is still unknown why it is so much better. AI would be capable of doing this on a massive scale, running thousands of different designs through simulations simultaneously, and finding the most optimal for the job.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!-- Negatives -->
				<div id="ethics_negatives" class="item">
					<h3>Negatives</h3>

					<ul>
						<li id="ethics_loss_of_jobs">
							<strong>Loss of Jobs</strong><br>
							In today's society, more and more jobs are being replaced with AI. While this is a good thing for the companies utilising it, it's becoming an increasing problem for society, as it's resulting in less job opportunities for humans.
						</li>
						<li id="ethics_data_manipulation">
							<strong>Data Manipulation</strong><br>
							With AI advancing so fast, it's becoming increasingly difficult to differenciate between real and manipulated data - especially with tools like <em>Deepfake</em> designed to convincingly replace one person with another in images and videos.
						</li>
