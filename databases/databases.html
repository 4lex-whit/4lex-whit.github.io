				<!-- Primary Keys -->
				<div id="keys-primary" class="item">
					<h3>Primary Keys</h3>
					<p>Each record must have a <em>Primary Key</em>. They are used to identify each record, and therefore must be <strong>unique</strong>. They also <strong>cannot be null</strong>, as they then wouldn't be unique.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Foreign Keys -->
				<div id="keys-foreign" class="item">
					<h3>Foreign Keys</h3>
					<p>A <em>Foreign Key</em> is used to reference a <strong>primary key</strong> from another table. Unlike primary keys, a foreign key can have a value of null, as they can repeat.</p>
					<p>For example, a database used for a college might have two tables - one for courses and one for students. To avoid repeating data, the students table would use the course IDs as a foreign key to keep track of the courses students are enrolled in.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Composite Keys -->
				<div id="keys-composite" class="item">
					<h3>Composite Keys</h3>
					<p>A <em>Composite Key</em> is when two or more <strong>fields</strong> are combined to make a <strong>primary key</strong>. These fields can be foreign keys, but do not have to be.</p>
					<p>For example, a database used for a library might combine the customer's ID, the book's ISBN, and the date to make a unique primary key.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Secondary Keys -->
				<div id="keys-secondary" class="item">
					<h3>Secondary Keys</h3>
					<p>A <em>Secondary Key</em> is a <strong>field</strong> used for <strong>sorting</strong> and/or <strong>searching</strong>. They can be foreign keys, but do not have to be.</p>
					<p>For example, a database used for a company might have a table of employees which contains a <em>Surname</em> field. This is both used to store essential information, but also to sort and search through all the employees.</p>

				<!-- What is Referential Integrity -->
				<div id="referential-integrity_what-is" class="item">
					<h3>What is Referential Integrity?</h3>
					<p><em>Referential Integrity</em> is a rule that can be applied to a relational database in order to maintain valid relationships between tables. This rule states <strong>the value in a foreign key field must either reference a valid primary key, or be null</strong>.</p>
					<p>It's an essential rule to follow - especially when working with larger databases - as primary keys will inevitably be updated or deleted, and foreign keys (if not updated accordingly) will end up referencing non-existent values. Due to those records not having a valid reference, they now becomes lost in the database as they won't show up in new queries, and will waste storage space.</p>

					<h3>Advantages</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Keeps data consistent and accurate</li>
						<li>Prevents orphaned records</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<!-- Disadvantages -->
				<div id="referential-integrity_disadvantages" class="item">
					<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Can impact performance due to additional checks</li>
						<li>Will require additional planning and design</li>
					</ul>
