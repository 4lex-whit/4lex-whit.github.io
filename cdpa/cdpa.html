                <h2>What is the Copyright, Designs, & Patents Act?</h2>
                <p>The <em>Copyright, Designs, & Patents Act</em> was introduced in 1988, and protects the <strong>intellectual property</strong> (defined as <em>"intangible creations of the human intellect"</em>) of a person or organisation.</p>
                <p>Copyright is <strong>automatically</strong> applied to <strong>original</strong> pieces of work, and - depending on the type of work - will only expire 25 to 70 years after the owner's death.</p>

                <h2>What Breaches the CDPA?</h2>
                <p>Breaches of the Copyright, Designs, & Patents Act are divided into two categories; <a href="#breaches_primary">Primary Breaches</a> and <a href="#breaches_secondary">Secondary Breaches</a>. However, if a person or organisation has the <strong>relevant permission</strong>, it does not breach the act.</p>
                <p>If someone believes their copyright has been breached, it is their responsibility to take action under the act.</p>
