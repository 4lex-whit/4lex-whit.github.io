				<h2>What is the Data Protection Act?</h2>
				<p>
					The <em>Data Protection Act</em> was introduced in 1998 to protect the <strong>collection</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, and <strong>storing</strong> of data. If these laws are broken, the organisation is referred to the <em>Information Commissioner's Office</em>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Collection -->
			<div id="collection" class="border_left">
				<h2>Data Collection</h2>
				<p>According to the <em>Data Protection Act 1998</em>, organisations have to have a <strong>legitimate reason</strong> to collect data. For example, a revision website could ask to collect your email address so they can contact you, but not things like your height and weight.</p>
				<p>The data is categorised into either <strong>Personal</strong> or <strong>Sensitive</strong> data. For example, personal data for a college could be a student's name, address, or phone number, while sensitive data could be your policial party, religion, bank account number, etc.</p>
				<p>Data is categorised differently depending on the purpose of the organisation - while a bank account number would be sensitive for a college, it would be personal for a bank. A company must be authorised to store sensitive data on a subject.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Processing -->
			<div id="processing" class="border_left">
				<h2>Data Processing</h2>
				<p>Data processing must be done <strong>lawfully</strong>, <strong>transparently</strong>, and <strong>in a fair way</strong>. This means the organisation must be clear on what information is stored about a subject, and what it's used for.</p>
				<p>The term <em>fair</em> is potentially problematic, as what an organisation deems fair might not be the same as what the subject does.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- Storage -->
			<div id="storage" class="border_left">
				<h2>Data Storage</h2>
				<p>The <em>Data Protection Act 1998</em> states that data must be <strong>accessible</strong> to the subject. This means that, if requested, the organisation has to provide the subject with all the data they have concerning them.</p>
				<p>In addition to this, data must be stored in a <strong>timely manner</strong>. This means that an organisation can only store data for as long as it is necessary, and it must be deleted when no longer. For example, a college would be required to delete your photograph after you leave, as it's no longer required for them.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- GDPR -->
			<div id="gdpr" class="border_left">
				<h2>What is the GDPR?</h2>
				<p>The GDPR stands for the <em>General Data Protection Regulation</em>, and it was introduced by the <strong>European Union</strong> to further regulate the processing of person data in 2018.</p>
				<p>This regulation gave subjects more rights about their data, allowing them to <strong>request data be deleted</strong>, and forcing organisations to <strong>request to store data on children</strong>.</p>
